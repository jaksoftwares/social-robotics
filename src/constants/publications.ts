        "description": "This study examines how children and the robot NAO coordinate gaze during the 'Memory' card game. Analyzing mutual gaze, gaze following, and joint attention, it found that these behaviors enhanced children's engagement, improving the robot's effectiveness as a tutor in educational interactions."

        "description": "As online communication increases, nonverbal cues are often missed in text interactions. This study explores how people use text symbols like capital letters, exclamation marks, and response timing to express emotions, aiding in the development of emotion recognition models for informal communication."

        "description": "Personalizing education to a child's developmental stage is common, but it's newer in robot-based learning. This pilot study integrates Pivotal Response Training (PRT) into a robot-child game, finding that increased social complexity boosted children's happiness and engagement, despite consistent challenge levels."

        "description": "This study examines how a robot tutor's gaze hints influence children's behavior in a card matching game. In two sessions, children performed better, with fewer attempts and increased mutual gaze with the robot in the 'Help' session, demonstrating enhanced tutor effectiveness with dynamic gaze cues."

        "description": "Gaze is crucial for directing attention in human communication. This study investigates how well people perceive gaze cues from a NAO robot versus a human during a board game. Participants identified targets more accurately when the robot's head pitch was higher and closer, though targets on the robot's left were harder to discern. The results provide insights for improving human-robot interactions in social and educational settings."
