As robots become more integrated into these environments, it is crucial to ensure that they can build trusting relationships with people and operate in ethically and culturally acceptable ways.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Responsible Computing (RC) project</strong> seeks to embed responsible computing and ethical considerations in robotics design and development. These principles include:</p>\n\n<ul class='list-disc list-inside pl-8 space-y-2'>\n    <li><strong>Inclusivity and Accessibility</strong> – Ensuring robots are designed to serve diverse populations, including individuals with disabilities and those from different cultural backgrounds.</li>\n    <li><strong>Ethical Design</strong> – Prioritizing fairness, transparency, trust, and privacy in robotic interactions.</li>\n    <li><strong>Societal Impact</strong> – Considering the economic and social aspects, ensuring that they promote empathy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>This project is funded by the Mozilla Foundation and USAID (2023–2025).</strong></p>",
